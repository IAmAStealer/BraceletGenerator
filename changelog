            - Mouse button bindings in OS X
            - Added script to add Ghostscript path to the system path variable

        3. Compatibility

            - Added compatibility with Tcl/Tk 8.5 since python does not
              support Tcl/Tk 8.6 on OS X.

* Bracelet Generator 1.3

    - Version 1.3.1

        Bug correction: error when opening the "about" toplevel

        Bug correction: error when opening a file that does not exist

        Replaced .pdf offline help by a .html page

    - Version 1.3.0

        1. Switch to python3 instead of python2 because it is the future of python
           and there are less string encoding issues than with python2

        2. New features

            - Main window
                + Color manager: possibility to change default color and to change
                  the color of all the strings of a given color
                + String and row numbering
                + Rounded tips for the strings

            - Two-Colored Motif Editor
                + The motif can be shifted along eight
                   directions (north, north-east, east, south-east, south, south-west,
                               west, north-west)
            - Both
                + Recently opened files sub-menu
                + More complete menus
                + More keyboard shortcuts
                + Possibility to enter the desired number of strings and rows
                + More readable configuration file (using configparser),
                  the software remembers the default color and the string/row
                  numbers of the last pattern
                + For linux platform: replaced tkinter filedialog and colorchooser
                  by zenity for a better integration

        3. Removals

            - New Bracelet dialog since everything can be
              easily specified from the main window

            - ImageTk not needed anymore to display images

            - Imagemagick not needed anymore to convert the .ps exported from
              the canvas in .png or .jpg (PIL and ghostscript are enough).
              Therefore, the path to 'convert' is useless now.

* Bracelet Generator 1.2

    - Version 1.2.2

        Little correction of the export function

    - Version 1.2.1

        Bug correction concerning the path to the convert function of ImageMagick
        (necessary to export to .png).

    - Version 1.2.0

        1. Improvements

            - When a bicolor motif file is opened, the editor comes on top of the main window
            - The software remembers the last path used

        2. New feature

            - The pattern can be vertically symmetrized
