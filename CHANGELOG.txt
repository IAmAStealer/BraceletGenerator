    Bug correction: mousescrolling was not working in Windows 
    and the mouse buttons were not correctly boundin OS X
    
    Added compatibility with Tcl/Tk 8.5 for Mac OS X since python does not

    Bug correction: error when opening a file that does not exist

- Version 1.3.0

    Changes between 1.3 and 1.2

        1. Switch to python3 instead of python2 because it is the future of python 
           and there are less string encoding issues than with python2

        2. New features

            - Main window
                + Color manager: possibility to change default color and to change 
                  the color of all the strings of a given color
                + String and row numbering
                + Rounded tips for the strings
                
            - Two-Colored Motif Editor
                + The motif can be shifted along eight
                   directions (north, north-east, east, south-east, south, south-west, 
                               west, north-west)
            - Both
                + Recently opened files sub-menu
                + More complete menus
                + More keyboard shortcuts
                + Possibility to enter the desired number of strings and rows
                + More readable configuration file (using configparser), 
                  the software remembers the default color and the string/row 
                  numbers of the last pattern
                + For linux platform: replaced tkinter filedialog and colorchooser 
                  by zenity for a better integration 
            
        3. Removals

            - New Bracelet dialog since everything can be 
              easily specified from the main window

            - ImageTk not needed anymore to display images

            - Imagemagick not needed anymore to convert the .ps exported from 
              the canvas in .png or .jpg (PIL and ghostscript are enough).
              Therefore, the path to 'convert' is useless now.

-----------------------Bracelet Generator 1.2-----------------------------

- Version 1.2.2

    Little correction of the export function
    
- Version 1.2.1

    Bug correction concerning the path to the convert function of ImageMagick
    (necessary to export to .png).

- Version 1.2.0

    Changes between 1.2 and 1.1

        1. Improvements

            - When a bicolor motif file is opened, the editor comes on top of the main window
            - The software remembers the last path used 

        2. New feature

            - The pattern can be vertically symmetrized
